## Installation

To set up your instance of Portfolio Craft, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (preferably the latest stable version)
- npm package manager (you can use yarn, but this guide assumes you're using npm)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/Gaurav241/portfolio-craft.git
cd portfolio-craft
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```
npm install
```
3. **Set up environment variables**

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the variables:

- `HYGRAPH_URL`: The endpoint URL of your Hygraph project.
- `HYGRAPH_TOKEN`: The access token for your Hygraph project.
- `WEBHOOK_URL`: The Discord webhook URL for contact notifications.

Your `.env` file should look something like this:
```
Hygraph
HYGRAPH_URL="https://your-hygraph-project-url"
HYGRAPH_TOKEN="your-hygraph-access-token"

Discord
WEBHOOK_URL="your-discord-webhook-url"
```
4. **Hygraph Project and Discord Webhook Setup**

- For your portfolio to properly fetch content, you need to clone the schema and content model from the provided Hygraph project clone. Follow the instructions on [Clone my Hygraph Project](https://app.hygraph.com/clone/dc8fc00574e94c3b83b6c44845d4babe?name=Portfolio-craft-tutorial) to import the schema into your project. This ensures your portfolio can communicate with Hygraph to retrieve your dynamic content.

- To set up the Discord webhook for contact notifications, go to your Discord server settings, select 'Integrations', click on 'New Webhook', and choose the channel you want the notifications to go to. Once created, copy the webhook URL and paste it into your `.env` file under `WEBHOOK_URL`.

5. **Run the development server**
```
npm run dev
```
This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits.
